# R + AppVeyor [![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/krlmlr/r-appveyor?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/krlmlr/r-appveyor/branch/master) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krlmlr/r-appveyor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krlmlr/r-appveyor)

This is a solution for continuous integration for R projects on Windows, using [AppVeyor](http://appveyor.com) -- a CI testing service similar to [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org).
Under the hood, [r-travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis) is used to perform the testing; this works even on Windows thanks to [MinGW and MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/).


Usage
-----

1. Sign up to [AppVeyor](http://appveyor.com).
2. [Enable testing](https://ci.appveyor.com/projects/new) for your project.
3. Run `devtools::use_appveyor()` in your project.
4. (Optional) Adapt `appveyor.yml` to your needs according to the [documentation](http://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml).
5. (Optional) Add a badge as described by the output of `devtools::use_appveyor()`.
6. Be sure to supply a `.gitattributes` file that takes care of fixing CRLF conversion settings that are relevant on Windows.  [The one in this repo](/.gitattributes) can be used for starters.
7. Push to your repo to start building.
8. Enjoy!


Build and test commands
-----------------------

The `travis-tool` used in `appveyor.yml` is a [modified copy](https://github.com/krlmlr/r-travis) of the r-travis project, documentation is available [on its wiki](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis/wiki#configuration-options).



Environment variables
---------------------

These can be set in the `appveyor.yml`, overriding the defaults. [This repo](https://github.com/krlmlr/r-appveyor/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L20) tests several configurations at once in a build matrix, see also the [build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/krlmlr/r-appveyor/branch/master).

- `R_VERSION`: The version of R to be used for testing. Specify `devel`, `patched`, `stable` (or `release`), `oldrel`, or a version number.
- `R_ARCH`: The architecture to be used for testing, one of `i386` (default) or `x64`.
- `RTOOLS_VERSION`: The version of Rtools to be used for testing, defaults to the most recent Rtools. Specify e.g. `33` for Rtools 3.3.
- `USE_RTOOLS`: Set `USE_RTOOLS: true` if Rtools needs to be installed, e.g. if you use install_github or if there are packages in Remotes: in your DESCRIPTION file. Defaults to `false`.
- `GCC_PATH`: The path to GCC in the Rtools installation, currently one of `gcc-4.6.3` (default), `mingw_32` or `mingw_64`.
- `WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS`: Set to 1 to treat all warnings as errors, otherwise leave empty.
- `CRAN`: The CRAN mirror to use, defaults to [RStudio's CDN via HTTPS](https://cran.rstudio.com). Change to [HTTP](http://cran.rstudio.com) for R 3.1.3 or earlier.
- `R_BUILD_ARGS`: Arguments passed to `R CMD build`, defaults to `--no-manual`.
- `R_CHECK_ARGS`: Arguments passed to `R CMD check`, defaults to `--no-manual --as-cran`.
- `PKGTYPE`: Passed as `type` to `install.packages()`, `remotes::install_deps()` and `devtools::install_deps()`.

Currently, all builds use the `--no-multiarch` switch for checking, and all vignettes (and the `VignetteBuilder` entry in `DESCRIPTION`) are removed prior to building (due to the absence of pandoc and LaTeX which are likely to be needed).


Artifacts
---------

In contrast to Travis-CI, AppVeyor offers facilities for hosting artifacts.  This can be configured by adding a section to the `appveyor.yml`.  The sample file is configured to deploy logs, and source and **binary** versions of the built package.  Check the "ARTIFACTS" section for [your project at AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/projects).


Acknowledgements
----------------

This wouldn't have been as easy without [r-travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis) and the experience gained there. Thanks!


See also
--------

The [win-builder project](http://win-builder.r-project.org/) has been around much longer and provides more comprehensive testing; you still might want to use this service before submitting to CRAN.
